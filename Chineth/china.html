    <h2>

      Chinese youth are no longer as overtly political. Growing up in a environment of censorship has influenced the way we think, act, and express ourselves.
      We do not have as many opinions, as much passion.
      <br>
      <br>
      There is an atmosphere of fear and inability now, and youth resistance has been reduced to jokes and internet memes.
      We don’t care about politics because we can’t affect it.
      <br>
      <br>
      It is enough to have enough to eat and live an easy life.
      <br>
      <br>
    The only power Chinese people have is purchasing power.
    Many brands are available to Chinese people.
    There are many items to consume.
    There is a lot of choice in what to consume.   
    <br>
    <br>
    Chinese brands are all controlled, monitored, and manipulated by the state.
    They cannot exist outside of state authority.
    No matter what Chinese people buy, they are still buying into CPC control.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is China post-Mao.

            This is socialism with Chinese characteristics. </a>
